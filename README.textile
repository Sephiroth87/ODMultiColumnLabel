ODMultiColumnLabel is a UILabel replacement that renders text on multiple columns, without any major hassle

h2. Requirements

Since it's based on TextKit, ODMultiColumnLabel requires iOS 7.0 or greater

h2. Installation

__*Important note if your project doesn't use ARC*: you must add the @-fobjc-arc@ compiler flag to @ODMultiColumnLabel.m@ in Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources.__

* Drag the @ODMultiColumnLabel/ODMultiColumnLabel@ folder into your project. 
* @#import "ODMultiColumnLabel.h"@

h2. Usage

(see sample Xcode project in @/Demo@)

Create the label as normal, via code or Interface Builder

h3. Customization

The @ODMultiColumnLabel@ can be customized using the following properties:

<pre>
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSUInteger numberOfColumns;   // default is 1
@property (nonatomic, assign) CGFloat columnsSpacing;       // default is 14.0
</pre>

h2. Known limitations

Currently, ODMultiColumnLabel works best if the label has no fixed height, either using Autolayout's intrinsic content size or -sizeToFit.
Forcing a smaller height to the label will currently crop the bottom part
